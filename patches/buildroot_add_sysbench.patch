From: Sergey Romanov <svromanov@sberdevices.ru>

This benchmark was designed for identifying basic
system parameters, as they are important for system
using MySQL (w Innodb) under intensive load.
Handling of IO in case of many parallel requests,
checked as well as memory allocation/transfer
speed and scheduler performance.
CPU is benchmarked by using 64bit integer manipulation
using Euklid algorithms for prime number computation.
Benchmarks are designed to show benefit of multiple
CPUs as well as of multiple hard drives,
battery backed up write cache.
